#Extra Practice

Create a `BankAccount` class. Your bank account should be able to:

* accept funds for deposit
* withdraw funds (if available!)
* compound interest

Consider what information you will need for this class. Write some tests, code up the class, then make sure it works.

Once that's finished, create a second class called `Bank`. A `Bank` class is essentially a container for `BankAccounts`. A bank should be able to:

* open a new account
* close an account
* deposit funds into a specific account
* withdraw funds from a specific account
* retrieve the total amount of funds in all of the accounts

Don't be afraid to go back and alter your `Bank` class if necessary. Make sure to write tests for each of your methods!
